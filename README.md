# Rust IRON App with a Flatpak Manifest

This is a very simple app that uses the current Rust extension for Flatpak to build and run as a regular flatpak app but instead serve up a web app using IRON.

You will need to build and install the Rust Flatpak extension for this to work, it's not currently hosted anywhere.
